= UbiquoJobs

This plugin provides a simple way to create jobs and workers that will execute them
A _job_ is mainly a piece of work that usually require some time and is not suitable for synchronous execution, and that can be modeled and parameterized

A _worker_ will look for planified jobs and execute them considering the priority. 

== System setup
To be able to run a worker, you need the following:
* A Rails app with this plugin installed.
* A system utility to monitor the worker (such as monit).

This plugin uses a transparent backend to store job information. To configure the backend,
set :job_manager_class in Ubiquo::Config to the class that will manage jobs.
See rails/init.rb for the default configuration (which is using the app DB as the backend)

=== Notifications
If you want to use notifications, set the :job_notifier_class that you will be using 
to Ubiquo::Config

== Usage example

First, let's create a Job class:

	class MyJob < UbiquoJobs::Jobs::Base
		def do_job_work
			# asynchronous work is here
		end
	end

Now, to run our MyJob:

  MyJob.run_async(:options => options, :planified_at => Time.now.utc)

Please note that all times in Jobs are interpreted as UTC.
Now, start a worker. Every worker must have a unique id:

  script/ubiquo_worker worker_id
  
That's all - The worker will find the job and execute it immediately, since the planification threshold has been overcame
To stop all the running workers use:

  script/ubiquo_worker --stop

== Creating job types
For every different kind of work that you want to be done you need to create a new job type (subclass of UbiquoJobs::Jobs::Base). You can then parameterize the options, perform validations, etc.
Basicly you have to override the do_job_work function and place there the work that will be performed when the worker starts the job
You can use virtual attributes to get parameters for do_job_work, but every thing that is not stored in the options hash will likely be lost at runtime, since only the options hash has the persistence guaranteed.
See UbiquoJobs::Examples::ExampleJob for a very basic example of a job type subclass

== Other features
* Use ShellJob to easily wrap commands in jobs and store the result code and output in the DB
* You can specify dependencies between jobs (X will not be run before Y and Z are done, etc)
* If a worker is killed while running a job, restart it with the same id and the job will be planified again
* A failing job command (with a result code != 0) will be automatically rerun for 3 times, not necessarily by the same worker, to circumvent potential environment or circumstantial issues.
* Use UbiquoJobs::Jobs::Base::STATES to find the state of a job
* Jobs will be executed using the priority order (priority => 1 > 2 > 3 etc) 
* Jobs will not be executed until their planified_at time
