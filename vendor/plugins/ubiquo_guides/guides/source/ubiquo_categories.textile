h2. Ubiquo Categories

The ubiquo_categories plugin provides a simple mechanism for organize
and categorize the content of your website, adding a generic category
system for your models and forms.

The idea of the plugin is to make easy the typical case of news
categorization, write post tags or choose from a items list one type of
task.

Addition to defining the structure of categories system, we needed to
have helpers for views, filters, connect it with ubiquo_i18n
mechanism... To do this, we consider building a plugin that accomplish
all our requirements.

The main features are:

 * Define generic category sets or complete free sets to categorize your models.
 * Use these categories with only two lines of code, one for the model and other for the views
 * Provide a built-in filter to search categorized records

h3. CategorySet

The purpose of CategorySet is group and order related categories. One
example of CategorySet would be 'Colors' that could contains 'Red',
'Blue', 'Green' categories.

Then, you can use one or various sets to categorize your models.

You can create a CategorySet from code:

<ruby>
CategorySet.create(:name => "Colors", :key => "colors", :is_editable
=> false)
</ruby>

or you can use ubiquo forms to do this.

h3. Category

You can create Categories for one CategorySet from code:

<ruby>
set = CategorySet.find_by_key("colors")
set.categories << "red"
</ruby>

Also, you can use ubiquo forms to create new categories or through
the category selector (we view it in next section)


h3. Categorize your models

If you want to categorize your model with one CategorySet you need to use
categorized_with statement.

Your model must have something like that:

<ruby>
class Painting < ActiveRecord::Base
  # ...
  categorized_with :colors, :size => :many
  # ...
end
</ruby>

h4. categorized_with options

categorized_with only needs a CategorySet key to work but it accepts
some options to customize it's usage:

h5. size

By default categorized_with creates a 1-1 relation, but you can specify size. Examples:

<ruby>
class Painting < ActiveRecord::Base
  # ...
  categorized_with :painter # relation 1-1
  categorized_with :colors, :size => :many # relation 1-*
  categorized_with :styles, :size => 3 # relation 1-1..3
  # ...
end
</ruby>

h5. separator

You can create and assign multiple categories, and it accepts an array
or string with separator. View the example:

<ruby>
painting = Painting.first
painting.colors << ["red", "green", "blue"]
painting.colors << "orange##yellow##purple"
painting.save
</ruby>

If you want other separator, you must specify it:

<ruby>
class Painting < ActiveRecord::Base
  # ...
  categorized_with :colors, :size => :many, :separator => "|"
  # ...
end
</ruby>

then, you can use it:

<ruby>
painting = Painting.first
painting.colors << "orange|yellow|purple"
painting.save
</ruby>

h5. from

Maybe this is more ambiguous option, but can be very useful. Imagine
that you want to have different CategorySets for very similar
concepts. Would be ideal to access with the same key to differents collections.

View an example:

<ruby>
class Book < ActiveRecord::Base
  # ...
  categorized_with :styles, :size => :many, :from => "book_styles"
  # ...
end

class Painting < ActiveRecord::Base
  # ...
  categorized_with :styles, :size => :many, :from => "painting_styles"
  # ...
end

CategorySet.create(:name => "Book Styles", :key => "book_styles")
CategorySet.create(:name => "Painting Styles", :key => "painting_styles")

book = Book.find_by_name("Confieso que he vivido")
book.styles << ["biography", "poetry"]

painting = Painting.find_by_name("Guernica")
painting.styles << "cubism"
</ruby>

h4. Find models by category

Sometimes you will need to find all the instances of a model which have a certain category.
This can be done easily with a helper provided by the plugin. Imagine you have a Book model
categorized by the Subject CategorySet. The you could use something like this:

<ruby>
science_books = Book.subject("Science")
</ruby>

This will find all the books that have "Science" in the category. You can pass more than one
category to the method:

<ruby>
math_books = Book.subject("Algebra", "Calculus")
</ruby>

This helper is created dynamically for each categorization of the model and has this form:

<ruby>
Model.<relation_name>(<list of categories>)
</ruby>

h3. Categorize from views!

The common case is that you need a selector for the form to choose options from
your CategorySets. You have available a helper for your form_for
called 'category_selector' and you can customize it easily.

h4. category_selector

<ruby>
<% form_for @painting do |form| %>
...
<%= form.category_selector :styles %>
...
<% end %>
</ruby>

h5. type

Now, if you don't indicate any type, the selector determine how to show
it. There are three cases:
 * Available categories for this CategorySet are less than 7 and you
 only want choose one category: The type of selector is a select.
 * Available categories for this CategorySet are less than 7 and you
 want choose multiple categories: The type of selector is a multiple
 checkboxes
 * Available categories for this CategorySet are more than 6: The type
 of selector is a autocomplete textfield

Then, you can force type option using for example autocomplete:

<ruby>
<%= form.category_selector :styles, :type => 'autocomplete' %>
</ruby>

NOTE: As type, you can indicate **:checkbox**, **:select** or **:autocomplete**

h5. name

Automatically the value of selector fieldset has been get with
human_attribute_name(set_key) but you can use your custom caption
sending name param.

<ruby>
<%= form.category_selector :styles, :name => 'Selector example' %>
</ruby>

h5. autocomplete_style

By default, autocomplete_style is :tag, but you can choose :tag or
:list. Here are the examples:

 * Tag

!images/ubiquo_categories/selector-tag.png(Category selector with tag style)!

 * List

!images/ubiquo_categories/selector-list.png(Category selector with list style)!

h5. html_options


The category_selector helper prints a fieldset wrapper that contains
labels, selects, checkboxes... With this param you can add
html_options for fieldset and customize it appearance.


h3. Filter your elements with category set filters

There are available 'show_filters' and 'show_filter_info' helpers and you can add filters in your scaffolds searching your records by categories.

An example of code:

<ruby>
../app/helpers/ubiquo/paintings_helper.rb

...

def painting_filters
  filters_for 'Painting' do |f|
    f.category :colors
  end
end

...

</ruby>

By default, filter use t('ubiquo.category_sets.#{set_name}') to
translate the filter 'h3' caption, but if you want change it, needs
specify with caption option.

Ex: f.category :colors, :caption => 'Colors filter example'

h4. Why ubiquo_categories and what we were looking for?

At a technical level, we had to solve two common issues we faced many times developing our projects. Very often, we need to tag one model, describe it with some concepts, so we needed a tagging system. At the same time, we always need the models to have categories, types, styles, etc. These usually belongs to a closed set of possibilities, but sometimes it is something the end user can also manage. So far, we found that in every project we took a different decision: list of constant values in a hash, related models that can be managed... In the end, we were in the need for a categorization system.

These tagging and categorizing issues, that at a functional level can be seen as different things, were exactly the same for us down to the implementation arena. That's why we ended joining these two features into a single plugin.

On a more concrete level, we needed to define a model to group the categorization terms. This is the CategorySet. Any category belongs to a CategorySet, that means that we can have enterily different sets for the different concepts to use. For example for tags, it's as easy as creating a new CategorySet named Tags, another for Countries, Styles, Types, Colors... in the end, there are lots of things in the models that can be categorized.

Now, the original model just needs a single line such as "categorized_with :countries" and we have the categories/tagging system we aimed.

h4. Other plugins dependency

The only dependency for this plugin is ubiquo_core.

h4. Using it outside ubiquo (public part)

By default, the category_selector helper is only in UbiquoController. If you want to use ubiquo_categories for your public forms, you can do it by including the following module:

ApplicationController.send :helper, UbiquoCategories::Connectors::Base::current_connector::UbiquoHelpers::Helper

The selector html code is inside a fieldset, you can change its appearance using css to adapt it to your website look&feel.

h4. How to add the plugin to an existing project

For now, ubiquo_categories it's only available in edge (master branch). If you have an already started edge Ubiquo project and you want to use this new plugin, you have to do the following:


 * git clone git@github.com:gnuine/ubiquo_categories.git
 * [Optional] If your project is using ubiquo_i18n for multilingual purposes, you can decide to use translatable categories. By default they aren't, to enable it you have to set the correct connector in the ubiquo config:

in config/initializers/ubiquo_config.rb add
Ubiquo::Config.context(:ubiquo_categories).set(:connector, :i18n)

 * rake ubiquo:install
 * rake db:migrate
