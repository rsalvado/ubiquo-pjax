h2. Ubiquo media

This plugin provides a media management system for Ubiquo. Once installed, you will be able to:

* Centralize and manage all the media files from the Ubiquo Media
  section: Create, edit or delete new assets that will be available
  throughout your app

* Easily enhance your models with a media selector: Add a single line
  to your model definition and it will be immediately able to store
  assets, without migrations


* Use an AJAX asset searcher on forms that will find assets as you
  type them

* Organize your assets by type or visibility: Restrict a model
  attribute to just some types of assets (images, videos...) and decide
  if the asset is public or private

* Crop images and select diferent areas for each format

endprologue.

h3. Media attachments

h4. Add media to a model

In your model, add:

<ruby>
media_attachment :resources, :size => N, :types => %w{image}
</ruby>

For example:
<ruby>
class ExampleModel < ActiveRecord::Base
  media_attachment :images, :size => 2, :types => %w{image}

  # .......

end
</ruby>

size and types options are optional. By default is sized 1 and any
type.

NOTE: You can use :many value with size option specifing that you want a undetermined number of assets.
NOTE: For convention, the attribute name should be always plural no matter if it contains a single element (size option is 1). The media_attachment accessor always returns an array.

h5. Minimum amount of assets

media_attachments able to set the maximum amount of related assets.

If you need to set the minimum, add something like this to your model:

<ruby>
validates_length_of(
  :images_ids,
  :minimum => 1
  )
</ruby>

NOTE: You can add a custom error message adding a :message option to the validates_length_of

h5. Media types

The available types are in the AssetType model, you can get it
running that in your script/console:

<shell>
$ script/console
Loading development environment (Rails 2.3.2)
>> pp AssetType.all.inject({}){|acc, at| acc[at.key] = at.name; acc}
{"audio"=>"Audio",
 "doc"=>"Document",
 "image"=>"Image",
 "video"=>"Video",
 "other"=>"Other",
 "flash"=>"Flash"}
=> nil

</shell>

The types of the :type option of the media_attachment method are the
keys of the hash printed in the script/console example.

Also, if you want to use all types, you can set it to :ALL. It's an
special value.


h4. Insert media selector to their form

In the ubiquo you have to add a media selector. To do that just call the helper:

<erb>
<% form_for ... do |form| %>
  ....
  <%= media_selector form, :images, :visibility => 'public' %>
  ....
<% end %>
</erb>

The first attribute is the form object.
The second is the name of the media attachment.
Visibility option can be 'public' or 'protected'.
This visibility determines if the resource can be accessed from anywhere(public) or requires to login in Ubiquo(protected). Default is public.


h4. Get the resource url

To get the url of a resource you can use url_for_media_attachment helper.
In that example there is a link to a resource:

<erb>
<%= link_to(
             "a link to the first image",
             url_for_media_attachment(object.images.first)
           ) %>
</erb>

h4. Get the resource name

When a resource is associated with something, that relation can be renamed.
This name is unique for the relation.

This is useful when a generic name is added when uploading the asset but in a relation it must be
named with a different name.

In that example there are a link to a resource showing their name:

<erb>
<%= link_to(
             object.name_for_asset(:images, object.images.first),
             url_for_media_attachment(object.images.first)
           ) %>
</erb>

h4. Get the thumbnail url

The url_for_media_attachment accepts an argument specifying a resource version. Versions are defined in
the configuration. To see it just put that in script/console:

<shell>
$ script/console
Loading development environment (Rails 2.3.2)
>> Ubiquo::Config.context(:ubiquo_media).get(:media_styles_list)
=> {:thumb=>"100x100>"}
</shell>

Then, to get this version url just type something like that:

<erb>
<%= link_to(
             "a link to the first image thumbnail",
             url_for_media_attachment(object.images.first, :thumb)
           ) %>
</erb>

h3. Media selector

When adding a media selectior initially you will see something like that:
!images/ubiquo_media/initial.png(Media selector initial state)!

Here, you can add new media or select existent.

h4. Upload media

If the 'add new media' option selected, a sub-form will appear.
!images/ubiquo_media/adding.png(Media selector adding state)!

Here you have to add a file and their name. When clicked in the
'save' button, the file will be uploaded with AJAX and will be
selected automatically

h4. Select media

If the 'select existent media' option selected, a list will appear.
!images/ubiquo_media/selecting.png(Media selector selecting state)!

Here you can search existent assets by their name and select it.

h4. Rename selection

When an asset is selected it has it's own name and a 'selection
name'. This name is only for that relation and can be changed from the
selected item view:
!images/ubiquo_media/selected.png(Media selector selected state)!

just click in 'change text' link.

h3. Image styles

When in your project you have spaces that have a defined size available for images
it's useful to define a format for that gap. This way, when you upload an image, 
a copy of that image is generated with the size defined.

On config/initializers/ubiquo_config.rb do:
<ruby>
Ubiquo::Config.context(:ubiquo_media).get(:media_styles_list).merge!({
    :vertical_banner => '60x200#',
    :avatar => '70x70#',
    :big => '640x480#',
    :header => '992x148#'
  }
)
</ruby>

Then you can use that version in the application:

<ruby>
url_for_media_attachment(object.images.first, :vertical_banner)
</ruby>

INFO: Each format means more storage and processing time required for every image uploaded.

h3. Ubiquo show helpers

For show pages, there are a couple of helpers that can help you to brainlessly
print a list of images and documents.

h5. Images

<ruby>
ubiquo_show_media_attachment_images(
      @instance,
      :media_field,
      'Images list'
    )
</ruby>

h5. Documents

<ruby>
ubiquo_show_media_attachment_docs(
      @instance,
      :media_field,
      'Documents list'
    )
</ruby>


h3. Media processors

h4. Add media processors

Processors let you pass the uploaded image or file through n:Number Processors, returning the processed file/image. By default, Ubiquo has the :thumbnail processor. In order to add a new processor, for example one named "watermark", in config/initializers/ubiquo_config.rb you should add:

<ruby>
  default_media_processors = Ubiquo::Config.context(:ubiquo_media).get(:media_processors_list)
  app_processors = [:watermark]

  Ubiquo::Config.context(:ubiquo_media).set do |config|
    config.media_processors_list = app_processors  + default_media_processors
  end
</ruby>

h4. Add a watermark

Continuing with the watermark example, in order to add that watermark functionality that corresponds to the processor, you should create the folder RAILS_ROOT/lib/paperclip_processors and add a file named "watermark.rb" to that folder with that code:

<ruby>
module Paperclip
  class Watermark < Processor

    class InstanceNotGiven < ArgumentError; end

    def initialize(file, options = {},attachment = nil)
      super
      @file = file
      @current_format   = File.extname(@file.path)
      @basename         = File.basename(@file.path, @current_format)
      @watermark        = Rails.root.join('/public/images/rails.png').to_s
      @current_geometry   = Geometry.from_file file # This is pretty slow
      @watermark_geometry = watermark_dimensions
    end

    def watermark_dimensions
      return @watermark_dimensions if @watermark_dimensions
      @watermark_dimensions = Geometry.from_file @watermark
    end

    def make
      dst = Tempfile.new([@basename, @format].compact.join("."))
      watermark = " \\(  #{@watermark} -extract #{@current_geometry.width.to_i}x#{@current_geometry.height.to_i}+#{@watermark_geometry.height.to_i / 2}+#{@watermark_geometry.width.to_i / 2} \\) "
      command = "-gravity center " + watermark + File.expand_path(@file.path) + " " +File.expand_path(dst.path)
      begin
        success = Paperclip.run("composite", command.gsub(/\s+/, " "))
      rescue PaperclipCommandLineError
        raise PaperclipError, "There was an error processing the watermark for #{@basename}" if @whiny_thumbnails
      end
      dst
    end
  end
end
</ruby>

h3. Use of different storage mode

Ubiquo Media have support for two different storage systems: filesystem, that is the default mode which comes with plugin, and s3, taking advantage from s3 storage system, and allowing user to configure s3 interaction with few lines of additional configuration.

h4. Configure project to use s3

This is a step by step, recipe like tutorial, to use ubiquo media with s3 storage system

1. Get s3 gem.
    sudo gem install s3

2. Edit config/initializers/ubiquo_config.rb and add the following lines
<ruby>
   Ubiquo::Config.context(:ubiquo_media).set do |config|
    config.media_storage = :s3
   end
</ruby>
3. Create a file called s3.yml under config/ folder

4. Populate the previous file with the following content:
<ruby>
   ENVIRONMENT:
     access_key_id: YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
     secret_access_key: YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
     bucket: YOUR_BUCKET 
</ruby>
5. Replace the previous upcase variables with your own data. Example:
<ruby>
   production:      
     access_key_id: 1234567abcd
     secret_access_key: abcdefghijk12345
     bucket: a_bucke_name 
</ruby>

h3. Using an Apache-based upload progress bar

There is a progress bar functionality available for apache based
environments. In a few steps, we will see how it can be accomplished:

# Install and activate drogus' apache-upload-progress-module from
  https://github.com/drogus/apache-upload-progress-module. Installation
  is well documented at source page
# Activate progress bar through the config option
<ruby>
Ubiquo::Config.context(:ubiquo_media).set do |config|
  config.progress_bar = true
end
</ruby>

And that's all folks! Progress bar is ready to run for your media uploads



h3. Crop and resize

The images can be cropped or select the part of the image for each format or style defined. This feature is builtin by default so nothing special have to be done.

The advanced form can be accessed form the assets tab and from any media selector.

!images/ubiquo_media/advanced-link.png(Media selector with advanced link)!

The "advanced" link brings a popup like that:

!images/ubiquo_media/advancededit-popup-66.png(Advanced edit form)!

h4. Localize format names

Image formats are defined as usual in the application but we can localize the names. The formats will
be shown in the "Predefined formats" tab:

!images/ubiquo_media/advancededit-formats-66.png(Advanced edit predefined formats tab)!

As you can see there appears the names of each format. These labels show the :humanize of the key by default but
you can define them by defining the i18n key "ubiquo.media.styles.#{style}.name".
<ruby>
en:
  ubiquo:
    media:
      styles:
        vertical_banner:
          name: Vertical banner
        avatar:
          name: Avatar
        big_format:
          name: Big format
</ruby>

h4. Keeping backups

By default, the advanced edit form keeps a backup of the original uploaded file
allowing to undo all changes done.

INFO: The "Restore to uploaded file" is only available when editing from the Assets list.

If you don't want this feature, you can disable the backups by configuration on initializers:

<ruby>
Ubiquo::Config.context(:ubiquo_media).set(:assets_default_keep_backup, false)
</ruby>
